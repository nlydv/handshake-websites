# My Handshake Domain Websites
This repo stores an organized collection of webpage files hosted on the various [Handshake](https://github.org/handshake-org) domains that I own. Just to make hosting/management easier as I move stuff around and am likely to accidentally delete stuff.

## Domains owned:
* [neel/](http://neel/)
* [neelyadav/](http://neelyadav/)
* [truedata/](http://truedata/)
* [grandview/](http://grandview/)
* [flops/](http://flops/)

## For sale
* [truedata/](https://namebase.io/domains/truedata)
* [grandview/](https://namebase.io/domains/grandview)

## Projects
I am currently playing with self-hosting a nameserver and DIY managing DNS records as a learning experiment. I've been using flops/ as the testbed for that. Once I have a firm grasp on that, I plan on hacking together a working email server on one of the domains with all the regular DNS records that go with it.

Currently I am able to send & recieve emails from my Handshake domain, `neel/`, at the address `yadav@neel`.
The proof-of-concept test for email usage on HNS domains was succesfully demonstrated for the first time ever between two indpendent mail servers behind HNS domains (as far as we know) in early February 2021. An image of the exchange between me (yadav@neel) and Sebastian Rasor (sebastian@rasor) below:

If you already have your own email server working on a HNS domain, send me some mail! It's quite lonely out here. Still working out the proper modifications to make it indistinguishably as functional as regular DNS domain emails, at least when it comes to emails purely between domains within the Handshake root zone.
