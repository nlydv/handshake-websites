# My Handshake Domain Websites
This repo stores an organized collection of webpage files hosted on the various [Handshake](https://github.org/handshake-org) domains that I own. Just to make hosting/management easier as I move stuff around and am likely to accidentally delete stuff.

## Domains owned:
* [neel/](http://neel/)
* [neelyadav/](http://neelyadav/)
* [truedata/](http://truedata/)
* [grandview/](http://grandview/)
* [flops/](http://flops/)

## For sale
* [truedata/](https://namebase.io/domains/truedata)
* [grandview/](https://namebase.io/domains/grandview)

## Projects
I am currently playing with self-hosting a nameserver and DIY managing DNS records as a learning experiment. I've been using flops/ as the testbed for that. Once I have a firm grasp on that, I plan on hacking a working email server on one of the domains with all the regular DNS records that go with it.

I'm already able to accept email at shake@flops. If you already have your own email server working on a HNS domain, send me some mail! It's quite lonely out here. As far as I know, I'm the only one in the world with an email server hooked up to an HNS domain...
